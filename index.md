# Course Overview

This course deals with the interrelated nature of language, technology, and society. We discuss the invention of writing as a language technology and how that gave rise to a series of cultural revolutions. We tackle the nature of society and what it means to be a social group, a social world. We will then move on to discuss language technologies such as the telegraph and discuss their impact on history. Finally, we will utilize the internet as a means by which we can re-evaluate our language and its impact on society on a global scale.

# Course Objectives

The main goal of this course is to excite an interest for and passion in language technologies in the attentive student. 

While many of us know a variety of things about some aspects of spoken language technologies like Siri or Alexa, this course should expound upon what you already know and garner a greater appreciation for the amazing resources available to this generation. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
* Discuss logically the origins of written systems of disparate types and analyze the efficacy of automated transcription, transliteration, and translation between them.
* Posit theoretical advancements to current language technologies that augment the social fabric of a given culture, creed, etc.
* Recognize the difficulty of creating a new technology to combat a challenge and overcome it in some significant way.
	 
**Please note: __this course is not a technical class__**. You will not be taught how to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system, or an AI system. However, we will be discussing the current state of research NLP and AI in broad strokes (among many other language technologies). If you are interested in these areas, the aim of this course is to give you a high-level survey of these fields and discuss the social significance of language technologies.
